The C4 model for visualising software architecture:
**Context**, **Containers**, **Components**, and **Code**

> "*The C4 model is an easy to learn, developer friendly approach to software architecture diagramming. Good software architecture diagrams assist with communication inside/outside of software development/product teams, efficient onboarding of new staff, architecture reviews/evaluations, risk identification (e.g. [risk-storming](https://riskstorming.com/)), threat modelling (e.g. [STRIDE/LINDDUN](https://daniel.spilsbury.io/2020/04/29/c4-threat-model.html)), etc*". - [C4 Model](https://c4model.com/)
